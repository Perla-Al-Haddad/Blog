# Configuring your database connection in .NET

In the following post, we'll explore how to set up and configure a database connection for your .NET Core or ASP.NET Core project.

This process involves adding and managing connection strings in the `appsettings.json` file, retrieving the connection string in C# code, and adding the necessary services to enable database access.

By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to connect your application to a database, an essential component for data storage and retrieval in your .NET Core project.

## Adding connection strings to `appsettings.json`

``` json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

We'll need to add the `ConnectionStrings` key-value. This will connect our project to a local Database called `BerryDb`. The file will end up like this:

``` json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=BerryDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true",
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

## Configuring the application to connect to the DB

You'll need to get the connection string from the configuration file in C#

``` C#
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
```

Then you'll Add the `DbContext` service to the builder

``` C#
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
```
