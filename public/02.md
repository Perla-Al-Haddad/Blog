# Data Access Layer

The Data Access Layer (DAL) is a fundamental component in the design of software applications, especially those that interact with databases or external data sources. It plays a crucial role in separating the business logic of an application from the details of how data is stored and retrieved. 

Purpose
---
The primary purpose of the Data Access Layer is to abstract and encapsulate the underlying data storage and retrieval mechanisms. It serves as an intermediary between the application's business logic (the Model) and the data store (e.g., database, web service, file system). By doing so, it offers several benefits:
- **Decoupling**: The DAL ==isolates the application's business logic from the specifics of the data storage technology==. This separation allows you to make changes to the data storage or database schema without affecting the rest of the application.    
- **Reusability**: The DAL can be reused across various parts of the application, promoting code reuse and maintainability. Multiple parts of the application can use the same DAL methods to access data consistently.
- **Security**: The DAL can enforce security measures, such as ==access control== and ==data validation==, to ensure that data is accessed securely and that ==only authorized users can perform specific operations==.

**Components of the Data Access Layer**
---
The Data Access Layer typically consists of the following components:

- **Data Models**: These represent the structure of the data stored in the data store. In an [[Object Relational Mapping (ORM)|Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)]] context, data models often map directly to database tables. 
- **Repositories:** Repositories are responsible for encapsulating the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for data models. They provide a clean and consistent API for interacting with the data store. In many cases, ==you'll have one repository per data model==.
- **Data Context/Connection**: This component manages the connection to the data store, whether it's a database connection or a connection to an external API. It handles tasks like opening and closing connections and managing transactions.
