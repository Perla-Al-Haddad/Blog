## ACID Transactions

ACID is an acronym that stands for `Atomicity`, `Consistency`, `Isolation`, and `Durability`. 

It is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. These properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably even in the face of system failures. 

Let's break down each of the ACID properties:

1. **Atomicity**: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that either all the changes made by a transaction are applied to the database or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. Atomicity helps maintain the integrity of the data.
2. **Consistency**: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another. In other words, the database must follow certain integrity constraints before and after the transaction. If a transaction violates any of these constraints, it is rolled back, and the database remains in its previous state. Consistency helps maintain the accuracy and validity of the data.
3. **Isolation**: Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of multiple transactions does not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to execute in isolation, as if it were the only transaction running on the system. This prevents problems like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, which can occur when multiple transactions access the same data simultaneously.
4. **Durability**: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any system failures such as crashes or power outages. This is typically achieved by writing the changes to non-volatile storage, like a hard drive or SSD, and ensuring that they can be recovered even after a failure. Durability ensures that data remains intact and consistent over time.

ACID transactions are crucial for applications that require data integrity, such as financial systems, airline reservations, and many others. However, it's important to note that enforcing ACID properties can sometimes lead to performance overhead, especially in distributed systems, which has led to the development of alternative models like BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) for certain use cases where relaxed consistency is acceptable

Certainly! Here's a revised version of your explanation of atomicity in database transactions with a different example:

## Ensuring Data Integrity with Atomic Transactions

In the world of database management, ensuring data consistency and integrity is paramount. 

One crucial concept in this realm is atomic transactions, which play a pivotal role in safeguarding against data corruption and ensuring that a database remains in a consistent state.

### Understanding Atomic Transactions

In the context of database operations, an atomic transaction is a fundamental concept. 

It guarantees that all the queries within a transaction must succeed for the changes to be committed to the database. If any single query within the transaction fails, all previous queries must be rolled back, ensuring that the database remains unchanged.
### The Importance of Atomic Transactions

To illustrate the significance of atomic transactions, let's consider a practical example involving bank accounts:

Suppose we want to transfer $100 from "Account A" to "Account B." Here are the initial account balances:

| Account   | Balance  |
| --------- | -------- |
| Account A | $1,000   |
| Account B | $500     |

We initiate a transaction, denoted as "TX1," to perform this money transfer. Within the transaction, we have a series of SQL queries:

``` SQL
BEGIN TX1

-- Step 1: Check the balance of Account A
SELECT BALANCE FROM ACCOUNT WHERE ID = 1

-- Step 2: Ensure there are sufficient funds in Account A
IF BALANCE >= 100

-- Step 3: Deduct $100 from Account A
UPDATE ACCOUNT SET BALANCE = BALANCE - 100 WHERE ID = 1
```

At this point, something unexpected happens â€” perhaps a system crash or a power outage, resulting in a database failure. In such cases, the atomicity of the transaction comes into play.
### Atomic Transactions in Action

1. **Database Failure Before Commit**: If the database crashes before we commit the transaction, all the changes made by the successful queries within the transaction are automatically rolled back. In our example, this means that the deduction of $100 from Account A will be undone, ensuring data consistency.

2. **Database Failure After Partial Execution**: Let's consider another scenario where the database crash occurs after the deduction from Account A but before the commit. In this case, atomicity ensures that the partial changes are rolled back, leaving the database in a consistent state. Account A will have its balance restored to $1,000, and Account B's balance remains unchanged.

This demonstrates the power of atomic transactions in maintaining data integrity and preventing situations where data is lost or left in an inconsistent state due to unexpected events.

In summary, atomic transactions provide a robust mechanism for preserving data integrity by ensuring that all queries within a transaction must succeed, or the database is rolled back to a consistent state, even in the face of unexpected failures. This fundamental concept is a cornerstone of reliable and resilient database systems.

Certainly! Here's a revised and expanded explanation of isolation in the context of database transactions, along with a different perspective on isolation levels:

**Title: Ensuring Data Consistency with Transaction Isolation**

In the realm of database management, ensuring data consistency and preventing unintended interactions between concurrent transactions is a critical concern. This is where the concept of transaction isolation comes into play. Transaction isolation defines how concurrent transactions interact with each other and whether an in-flight transaction can observe changes made by other transactions before they are committed.

## Understanding Transaction Isolation

Transaction isolation is a crucial aspect of database systems that governs the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other concurrently executing transactions. It ensures that the effects of an in-flight transaction are isolated from the effects of other concurrent transactions until the in-flight transaction is committed. 

This isolation prevents various anomalies, such as ==dirty reads==, ==non-repeatable reads==, ==phantom reads==, and ==lost updates==, which can compromise data consistency and integrity.

### Read Phenomena

Before delving into isolation levels, it's essential to understand the potential issues that can arise when multiple transactions interact:

1. **Dirty Reads**: Occur when a transaction reads a value that has been modified by another transaction that has not yet been committed.

2. **Non-repeatable Reads**: Involve a scenario where a transaction reads the same data multiple times but observes different values due to concurrent updates by other transactions.
![[Pasted image 20230923120151.png]]
``` SQL
-- Transaction A
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT ContactInfo FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;

-- Meanwhile, Transaction B
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Transaction B updates the same customer's contact information
UPDATE Customers SET ContactInfo = 'New Info' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
COMMIT;

-- Back to Transaction A
-- Transaction A re-executes the query
SELECT ContactInfo FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
-- Transaction A now sees the updated data, which differs from the initial read
COMMIT;
```

3. **Phantom Reads**: Happen when a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a certain condition, but another transaction inserts or deletes rows that meet that same condition, causing a change in the result set.
![[Pasted image 20230923120328.png]]
``` SQL
-- Transaction A
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM HotelRooms WHERE Price < 100;

-- Meanwhile, Transaction B
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Transaction B inserts a new room with a price below $100
INSERT INTO HotelRooms (RoomID, Price) VALUES (101, 99);
COMMIT;

-- Back to Transaction A
-- Transaction A re-executes the query
SELECT * FROM HotelRooms WHERE Price < 100;
-- Transaction A unexpectedly includes the newly inserted room, causing a phantom read
COMMIT;
```

4. **Lost Updates**: Occur when two transactions concurrently modify the same data, and one of them overwrites the changes made by the other, leading to data loss.
![[Pasted image 20230923120435.png]]
``` SQL
-- Transaction A and Transaction B
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Transaction A decreases the inventory by 5 units
UPDATE Products SET Inventory = Inventory - 5 WHERE ProductID = 1;
-- Transaction B decreases it by 3 units
UPDATE Products SET Inventory = Inventory - 3 WHERE ProductID = 1;
COMMIT;

-- If Transaction A commits first, it effectively "loses" the 3-unit update from Transaction B

```
### Isolation Levels for In-flight Transactions

To address these read phenomena and provide varying levels of data isolation, database systems offer different isolation levels:

1. **Read Uncommitted**: This level offers no isolation, meaning that an in-flight transaction can see changes made by other transactions, whether they are committed or not. It is the lowest level of isolation and can lead to various anomalies.

2. **Read Committed**: In this level, each query in a transaction only sees committed changes made by other transactions. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

3. **Repeatable Read**: At this level, the transaction ensures that once a query reads a row, that row remains unchanged while the transaction is running. It mitigates dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but may still encounter phantom reads.

4. **Snapshot**: In the snapshot isolation level, each query in a transaction only sees changes that were committed up to the start of the transaction. It provides a consistent snapshot of the database at that moment, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

5. **Serializable**: Transactions are executed as if they were serialized one after the other. This level offers the highest level of isolation and prevents all read phenomena but may result in slower performance due to increased locking.

It's important to note that each database management system (DBMS) implements isolation levels differently, and the exact behavior may vary between systems.
### Database Implementation of Isolation

To enforce isolation levels, DBMSs employ various strategies:

- **Pessimistic**: This approach uses locks at the row, table, or page level to prevent lost updates. It ensures that only one transaction can access a particular resource at a time.

- **Optimistic**: Instead of locking, optimistic concurrency control tracks changes and fails a transaction if conflicting changes are detected. It aims to minimize locking overhead.

- **Repeatable Read in PostgreSQL**: Some DBMSs, like PostgreSQL, implement repeatable read using a snapshot mechanism, which eliminates phantom reads without excessive locking.

- **Serializable with SELECT FOR UPDATE**: Serializable isolation can be implemented either optimistically or pessimistically. In a pessimistic implementation, the SELECT FOR UPDATE statement is used to lock rows explicitly.

In summary, transaction isolation levels play a critical role in ensuring data consistency and preventing anomalies in database transactions. Choosing the appropriate isolation level depends on the specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between data integrity and performance. It's essential to understand these levels and how they are implemented in your chosen DBMS to design robust and reliable database applications.
