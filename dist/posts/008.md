JWT, which stands for JSON Web Token, is a widely used method for implementing authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. 

It's a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties, typically a client and a server. JWTs are commonly used for ensuring the security of APIs and web applications by verifying the identity of users or systems. 

In this article, we will see how to configure JWT authentication for an ASP.NET core 7 Web API project.

## Project setup

We start by creating an ASP.NET core Web API project in visual studio. This will provide us with the following files:

``` lua
project/
|-- ...
|-- Controllers/
|	|-- WeatherForecastController.cs
|-- appsettings.json
|-- Program.cs
|-- WeatherForecast.cs
```

The `Program.cs` file contains the following basic code to help build our application:

``` js
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication();

var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

This is where we will be configuring our basic JWT authentication. The `WeatherForecast.cs` class contains the model used in the application, and the `WeatherForecastController.cs` class contains our basic API methods. We will come back to this file when it comes to configuring the Authorization levels of the methods.

## Adding Authentication to the `Program.cs` file 

We will need to start by installing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` in our project. This can be done using the NuGet package manager, or using the following command in the Package Manager Console:

``` bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
```

### Setting the Authentication Scheme

We can start by adding this line to the `Program.cs` file under the initialization of the builder:

``` js
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
...
```

This will specify to the builder which scheme we want to use for our application. Another way to do this to edit all default schemes would be the following code.

``` js
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(x =>
{
    x.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
});
```

This line instead is configuring the authentication system in a way that sets `JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme` as the default authentication scheme for challenges, authentication, and the overall default scheme. This configuration is more explicit and sets specific defaults for different aspects of authentication.

Here's some more details about the different default schemes:
- `DefaultChallengeScheme` - Specifies the default authentication scheme used for challenges. Challengers are typically used when a user needs to log in or provide additional authentication information.
- `DefaultAuthenticateScheme` - Specifies the default authentication scheme used for authentication. When a request comes in and requires authentication, this scheme will be used to determine how the authentication process should be handled.
- `DefaultScheme` - This sets the default scheme for the authentication system as a whole. It essentially specifies the default scheme to use when no explicit scheme is specified.

### Adding the JWT Bearer

We now must specify the `TokenValidationParameters` to show the application how to validate the tokens. We will append the following to the `AddAuthentication` call:

``` js
var config = builder.Configuration;

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(x =>
{
    x.DefaultScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(x =>
{
    x.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidIssuer = config["JwtSettings:Issuer"],
        ValidAudience = config["JwtSettings:Audience"],
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(config["JwtSettings:Key"]!)),
        ValidateIssuer = true,
        ValidateAudience = true,
        ValidateLifetime = true,
        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true
    };
});
```

***Note:*** *The key should never be stored in the configuration of the application. It should be stored in a more secure location like [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault)*

Here we are specifying the values for `ValidIssuer`, `ValidAudience`, and `IssuerSigningKey` which are used to verify the authenticity of incoming JWT tokens. 

The remaining properties (`ValidateIssuer`, `ValidateAudience`, `ValidateLifetime`, and `ValidateIssuerSigningKey`) specify whether to validate certain aspects of the JWT token, such as the issuer's identity, audience, token expiration, and the signature's validity.

To set the `JwtSettings` configuration for this project, we will edit the `appsettings.json`: 

``` json
{
  "JwtSettings": {
    "Issuer": "http://www.issuerexample.com",
    "Audience": "http://www.audienceexample.com",
    "Key": "donotstorethishere"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```
